scripts that i asked chat gpt to generate

TEMPDEL:
i choosed this name bc it was used only for empty'ing TEMP and %TEMP% folders but i also added "kill edge processes" and "set up power plan" because my power plan is changing after every system restart so now its faster to cahnge power plan. PLEASE CHANGE THE CODE BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT. thanks!
